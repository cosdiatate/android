            <h1>THE HISTORY OF THE MASCOT "BUGDROID"</h1>
            <p>You probably already know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by Google, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But perhaps you dont know that its charming mascot actually has a name and a very curious history! Stick around this article to learn plenty about this little robot</p>
            <h2>The First Version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot happened in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class= "externo"rel="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class= "externo" rel="external">Inkscape</a> (a free vector graphics software) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was simply to personify the system for his team—there was no company-wide request to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator: they were called the <strong>Dandroids</strong></p>
            <h2>Android has debuted a brand-new mascot</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot had matured, and the task was handed to a professional. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class= "externo" rel="external">Irina Blok</a>, who was also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more appealing way</p>

            <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="irina blok criadora"></picture>
            <p>Irina’s main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter style. The design also needed to allow for quick recognition by anyone viewing it. That’s how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>—the new Android mascot—was born.</p>
            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="bugdroid">
            <p>The primary inspiration for the design of the new Bugdroid came from the simplistic figures commonly found on restroom doors to indicate gender. Legend has it that while working at her desk in Google's office, Irina Blok glanced toward the bathroom signs and immediately recognized their effectiveness: simple, clean, and straightforward. This observation led to the creation of the Bugdroid, Android's new mascot. </p>

                <h3>Do you want to know more?</h3>
                <p>Another intriguing aspect of Android is its tradition of naming each version after a dessert, following an alphabetical order from version 1.5 up to 9.0. This practice began with Android 1.5, known as "Cupcake," and continued through to "Pie" in version 9.0. However, starting with Android 10, Google shifted to a numerical naming system, moving away from the dessert-themed codenames.</p>
                <div class="versionlist">
                    <img src="imagens/androidversionlist.png" alt="lista nomes">

                    <li>1.5 - <abbr title="Bolinho">Cupcake</abbr></li>
                    <li>1.6 - <abbr title="Sonho">Donut</li></abbr>
                    <li>2.0 - <abbr title="Bomba de chocolate">Eclair</abbr></li>

                    <li>2.3 - <abbr title="Biscoito de Gengibre">Gingerbread</abbr></li>
                    <li>3.0 - <abbr title="Mel">HoneyComb</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.0 - <abbr title="Sorvete">Ice Cream Sandwich</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.1 - <abbr title="Balinha">Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.4 -  <abbr title="Chocolate">Kitkat</abbr></li>
                    <li>5.0 - <abbr title="Pirulito">Lolipop</abbr></li>
                    <li>6.0 - <abbr title="Marshmallow">Marshmallow</abbr></li>
                    <li>7.0 - <abbr title="Torrone">Nougat</abbr></li>

                </div>
                    <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> never existed, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numerical versions, which led to the creation of Android 10.</p>
